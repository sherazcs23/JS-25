1. Naming Rules:
Allowed Characters:
Variable names can consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($). 
Starting Character:
Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). They cannot start with a digit. 
No Spaces:
Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase (e.g., firstName) or underscores (e.g., first_name) for multi-word names.
Case-Sensitive:
JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. Name and name are considered different variables.
Reserved Keywords:
You cannot use JavaScript's reserved keywords (e.g., function, if, const, let, var, return) as variable names.
