Q1 What are Data Types?
Data types define the kind of data a variable can store. They tell the programming language what kind of value is being dealt with â€” whether it's text, numbers, true/false, etc.

Q2.Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types:
  Answer
 TYP1  ==> Primtive DataType
    Primitive data types are the most basic and fundamental types provided by JavaScript.
    These include String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, undefined, null, and Symbol. 
    They hold simple, immutable values and are stored directly in memory.
    Primitive types are compared by their value.
    
 TYPE2 ==> Non Primitive Datatype
    Non-primitive data types, on the other hand, are more complex.
    These include Objects, Arrays, and Functions.
    They are used to store collections of data or more complex entities.
    Non-primitive types are stored by reference, not by value, meaning multiple variables can point to the same object in memory.
